I’m Laurencio a.k.a Lalo, I have been working professionally as a videogame programmer for more than 5 years. I have experience leading and managing programming teams of more than 7 people. I’m passionate about playing videogames but even more about creating them and sharing my knowledge with others. In my free time I write on Medium about the development and programming of videogames. I consider myself a disco dancer and an evangelist of vscode and darkmode.
